## Dan 6.0

With the 6th version in the series of what-an-i-doing-with-my-life, I add more Illuminate components to add dependency injection. Some other stuff too I guess.
 
### Requirements
 - PHP 7.0 (If you're not already running this, you heed help..)
 - Composer
 - Knowledge in JSON (sorry YAML people)
 - Basic PHP understanding for making custom commands (why wouldn't you want to make some?)
 - Knowing how GitHub works
 - ???
 - Have a kitten ![kitten](http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/16100000/Cute-Kitten-kittens-16122951-1280-800.jpg)

### Running the bot

```
php dan
```

(To enable debug mode, add `--debug` or set `dan.debug` to `true` in the config)

Tis' so simple.



#### More docs to come as I do this stuff.
